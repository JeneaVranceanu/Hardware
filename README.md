# Hardware
Repository is designated to hold any hardware related information like issues and fixes, schemes, specs, compatibility lists etc. It is open to the public but won't be maintained in terms of regular updates. It will just accumulate a hierarchy of sorted by topic information of the issues (and other thing) I've encountered myself and found interesting and useful to store.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
